# vpc_deployment_template
i am trying this new approach to deploy my personal project in aws cloud for a short time and they pull it down when needed 

sample architecture this terraform template will generate 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f39f7e26-cca8-4e71-94ad-43ff8851515a)

additionally added github action to manage the creation or to destroy the infra

This will be paired with a self sufficient application which initializes its db tables on the fly to keep the project ready to serve always
